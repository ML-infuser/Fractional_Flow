Fractional flow is a concept used in reservoir engineering to describe the relative flow rates of two immiscible fluids (usually oil and water) within a porous medium such as a reservoir rock. It is an essential tool for understanding and optimizing oil recovery processes such as water flooding or enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods.

Limitations:-
1)Fractional flow models often make simplifications and assumptions about fluid behavior and reservoir properties. For instance, linear fractional flow models assume constant relative permeabilities and may not accurately capture the complexities of fluid flow in heterogeneous reservoirs.

2) Fractional flow calculations heavily rely on estimates of relative permeabilities, which can be challenging to accurately measure or predict, especially in complex reservoirs. Errors in relative permeability data can lead to inaccurate predictions of fluid flow behavior.
